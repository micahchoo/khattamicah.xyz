[New Art City on Instagram: &quot;New Art City is looking for people who use screen readers to participate in a research project to make virtual art more accessible! Your feedback is vital to helping us achieve our accessibility goals and continue developing tools that serve you. We are recruiting a group of users to test the catalog view for either 30 or 50 minutes, depending on your availability. For 30 minute tests, we pay 30 dollars, and for 50 minute tests we pay 50 dollars.

New Art City is an artist-run virtual space where novice and experienced digital artists create 3D online exhibitions in the browser without code. Artists upload sound, 3D-models, images, videos, and text to multiplayer virtual spaces.

There is a screen reader accessible catalog view of each exhibit that is a normal web page you can scroll through to experience the artworks. The catalog view is a first step toward improving accessibility on New Art City. Accessibility in virtual space is a new field and we don’t see other spaces incorporating ground up accessibility in their roadmaps.

New Art City believes accessibility is intersectional. We want to reduce technical and geographic barriers for artists to show their work, and we want to increase opportunity for audiences to experience these exhibitions regardless of location, technical skill, or perceptual ability. 

🔗 (More on our mission at https://info.newart.city/mission-values)

✉️ Email team&#064;newart.city to arrange a slot with the accessibility panel.&quot;](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjJNW7tvoHd/?igshid=MDFiOTBkYzE)=
