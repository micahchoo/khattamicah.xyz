# Thoughts before the Capstone
The theories of care are many and diverse, I have started to look beyond the repository and the initial set of literature I had found. I started with the various frameworks of care and ethics in practice.
-   Through reading [[Worldly Ethics - The democratic ethics of care for worldly things]] and how Ellla Myers has defined the way she is talking about care, I started to do two things, I have started to form an understanding of how different people set apart their notions of care. Annemarie Mol for instance has approached it through the logics of practice. I need to read that in more detail, however, by bringing together a distinction that presupposes process in an established world she is different from Ella inasmuch as I have read. Ella sets it to be a worthy task to set up the world first. She defines the world of care in opposition to the self/other paradigm of care.
-   Hannah Arendt’s notion of amor mundi, or love of the world. It may be useful to look at the different ways love/something abstract like that has been theorised in more than the terms of self vs others.
-   She also centers the actions of care and divides the concepts etymologically by separating the caring about and caring for. Is it possible to do this for marathi and malayalam.
-   I am also starting a literature based inquiry into Indian ideas of care, through works of authors, I think this is a worthy pursuit because of the two stories I helped translate.
-   I need however, to prioritize the reading(literature) and writing(reflections) to be done before may 20. Its going to be a difficult task considering the length of some of these texts.
-   Ella myers for now must take priority.
-   Other than these, I might have to look at conversational interfaces and a way to understand the role of metatools in collaborative work.
-   I need to also understand how practice turns into research or knowledge produced.
-   Hysallo's [[The Mundane and Strategic Work in Collaborative Design]] is important again with Annemarie's understanding of care and how the routine work is important. I have to start looking at the clusters of care and how that fits with the worlds thing

## Clusters of care
   ### Oiling the Wheels - Archetypes
        -   The maintainers do the work of keeping things alive. Annemarie talks about this as lot more than just routine(mundane work). It is the understanding that in the \[\[logic of care\]\], things shift and conversations must keep happening. The maintainers keep an attitude of tenacity and adaptibility(AM) and learn to keep trying because the action is the moral activity of care.
        -   The maintainers that I have observed range from Shreyas to Vinay to Dilip to Supriya, from the understanding that the work must continue. As soon as the lockdown was announced, Shreyas got together with Geeta and Supriya in trying to build a website for DLL. It was a process of learning together on various platforms and trying things out.
        -   Design Beku. in a conversation about how the a big designer's collective was running the design equivalent of a hackathon. Naveen said how the long work has to find a home in db after the hackathon. The initial momentum of many of these projects had failed.
        -   This doesn't mean that the maintainers are strangers to failure. For a common lunch that was supposed to bring together various voices of Bidar to discuss the matter of responding to CAA-NRC, someone slipped through the invitations. I was told that it hurt because a woman writer had not been invited. Dilip told me later how it was a failure of planning and how it meant that she would drift apart a little. But he was confident in how they would win her trust back.
        -   Maintainers must also understand the role of people-their bodies, their practices and their places to hold networks together. Liyaqat sir, is a renowned collector of historical artifacts. Shreyas tells me that this also however his lament. When they met him for the first time, he lamented the fact that his children wouldn't keep up his practice and that this practice of held so little value in the eyes of the public. Whereas he had such amazing items ranging from \[\[dunno\]\]. He told me about how these artifacts and their stories made L a keeper of public memory rather than just a collector of antiquities. They therefore used some of the funds to send him timely appreciation packages for his work.
   ### Making as a practice
        -   The slow and Polished
        -   The quick and dirty
        -   Meta-tooling
  ###  Carefull-conversation
        -   Representational design
        -   Researching through learning
        -   Conflicts as a practice of care
   Archiving as a practice
    -   Unforgetting
	
	
# Thoughts about the Capstone - 1 year later

## Does it need to fit into a particular domain
	* Would domainifying this lead to its remediation
	* [[Commoning the Inbetweens- Compost Pitch#Reflections and Thoughts on the piece]] - remdiation in context 1
	* infrastructuring as meme - remediation in context 2	
## Paul's thoughts - 
"The archetypes work well because they can be plugged into different communities. a maintainer in one field looks very differernt in another"


## Archive
the first draft is hard to get out and I follow one of two approaches, gardening or planning or some hybrid. 
The writing process started off with a simple outline which I then followed with a graphic illustration of each of the section. This helped me sort out my metaphors and make a much more expanded outline. 
After talking to shreyas, I decided to strucure it the way that I would, without academic boundaries. Is there a translation possible between the two?
Even then my outline is now based the questions, and that allows for a little bit of Non-Linear Storytelling
